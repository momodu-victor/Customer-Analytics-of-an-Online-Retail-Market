# Customer-Analytics-of-an-Online-Retail-Market-with-RFM-and-Kmeans
The Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Online Retail realm is by nature a competitive environment that is currently facing high levels of investment to attract new customers while focusing on customer loyalty and profitability to increase market share. 
Hence it is crucial for companies to understand what the underlying causes behind a customer leaving the business. 
Therefore, firms are increasingly providing more focus to strategies in which they can reduce their customer churn rate while identifying customers' that bring true value. 
According to Renjith (2015), churn rate is the ratio of customers who part away with the firm in a specific time period. 
One of the best mechanisms to retain current customers is to identify any potential churn and respond fast to prevent it.
Detecting early signs of a potential churn, recognizing what the customer is looking for by the movement and automating personalized win back campaigns are essential to sustain business in this era of competition (Neslin et al., 2006). 
The following project aims to explore the likelihood of a customer leaving the online retail market through RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis. 
RFM is  a  proven  marketing  model  for  behaviour  based customer segmentation.  It groups customers based on their transaction history –how recently, how often and how much did they transact- based on the latter, they are provided a score which in this project will be used to predict customers that are at risk to churning while exploring different question from who are the best customers? Which of your customers can be retained? Who are the loyal customers? Where are our new customers?  
This project explores which customers are truly at risk to churn and it provides insights on which target incentives would be useful for customers to stay and extend the customer’s lifetime value (CLV) in the online retail market.
